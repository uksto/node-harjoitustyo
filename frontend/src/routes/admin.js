      <p>
        This is supposed to be an about site where I put my contact information.
        This time I wont put my contact information here because this is only a
        school exercise. I do realise that school exercises are important and
        I'm not trying to downplay them by saying "only a school exercise". That
        just means that this site is not meant to be viewed by anyone else than
        my teacher and in that case this site does not need my contact
        information. Thanks for attending my ted talk.
